# ASPC Main Site #

To start hacking on the ASPC main site, you will need [Vagrant]. Once you have
Vagrant installed, navigate to this directory in your shell and run:

    vagrant up

This will set up a virtual machine running the ASPC mainsite application in
something approximating a production configuration. To see it in action, visit 
[http://localhost:8080/]. For development, log in with username `developer` and 
password `developer`.

To run management commands, you'll need to ssh in to the VM:

    $ vagrant ssh
    vagrant$ cd /vagrant
    vagrant$ ./manage.py shell_plus

When you're done working, free up system resources with a `vagrant halt`. If you
want to start from scratch, `vagrant destroy` and then `vagrant up` anew.

(Applying future changes to the Vagrant setup will be done automatically when 
you `vagrant up`, but you can also run `vagrant provision` yourself.)

## Deploying to Peninsula ##

Ensure [Fabric] is installed (`pip install fabric`) and the `fab` command is
available. Create a file called `fabfile/config.py` and add your Peninsula
credentials in the following format:

    host_strings = [
        "yourname@peninsula.pomona.edu",
    ]

Then, to deploy:

  1. Assuming you have been doing work on a feature branch, check out master and
     `git merge yourfeaturebranch`.
  2. `fab stage`
  3. If everything looks good on staging, `fab deploy`.

## Auto-Reloading ##

GUnicorn workers have `max_requests = 1` set in `vagrant/gunicorn.cfg.py`. This
means that after at most one refresh, the worker will be running your code.

If you need to force a reload, use `vagrant ssh -c "service gunicorn reload"`.

## Enabling the Peninsula tunnel ##

Tunneling to Peninsula lets you access services with restrictive firewall rules.

  1. Copy `vagrant/ssh_config.example` to `vagrant/ssh_config`
  2. Edit `vagrant/ssh_config` to include your Peninsula username
  3. Copy your private key to `vagrant/peninsula.key`
  4. Set permissions with `chmod u=rw,g=,o= vagrant/peninsula.key`
  5. Update `aspc/settings.py` with credentials for the Course Data DB

Next time you `vagrant up`, a service will be started to tunnel traffic to the
Course Data DB. (If you are off-campus, you will have to `vagrant halt`,
connect to the Pomona VPN, and `vagrant up` again.)

## Project Layout ##

Under the main `aspc` folder in this directory are several subfolders, most of
which are Django "apps":

  - `auth` — Django auth backend supporting Pomona College accounts
  - `blog` — The Senate Blog (shown on homepage)
  - `coursesearch` — Course search & schedule builder. 
    Includes management commands to sync with ITS course database
  - `eatshop` — Local business & discount directory
  - `events` - 5C event calendar and scraper
  - `folio` — Simple CMS to add pages to ASPC site
  - `housing` — Housing directory & reviews
  - `menu` - 5C weekly dining hall menus
  - `minutes` — History of ASPC minutes + summaries
  - `sagelist` — aka SageBooks, student-to-student textbook sales
  - `senate` — Positions, appointments, and documents. Includes functionality
    to apply appropriate permissions to Senators when they log in during or 
    after their tenure as senators

Folders without an `__init__.py` are not apps, but contain supporting files:

  - `fixtures` — Fixture data for Coop Fountain page
  - `maps` — Residence hall maps for Housing app
  - `static` — Static assets (CSS/JavaScript) used in the site
  - `templates` — Certain site-wide templates that don't fit in a
    particular app

And some apps are placeholders that have yet to be fleshed out or removed:

  - `courses` — Currently used only for the Term model
  - `map` — Unused
  - `stream` — Unused (see notes on activity stream)
  - `vote` — Unused

## Running Locally ##

To run locally, you need Python >= 2.7 (<3.0), PostgreSQL, virtualenv,
virtualenvwrapper, and some patience. These instructions assume you are
using a Mac with [Homebrew] installed.

    brew install unixodbc # needed to compile pyodbc
    brew install freetds # needed to connect to JICSWS
    brew intall postgresql # for running a server locally
    mkvirtualenv aspc
    cd /path/to/your/mainsite/repo
    pip install -r requirements.txt # this will take a while
    
    # to start the PostgreSQL server before starting work:
    postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
    # alternatively, set it to start at login...
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    # ...and launch it now
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
    
    # create the db
    createdb
    psql -c "CREATE ROLE main LOGIN PASSWORD 'dev_password';"
    psql -c "CREATE DATABASE main_django WITH ENCODING = 'UTF-8' LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8' OWNER main TEMPLATE template0"
    
    # create db tables and superuser
    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate
    
    # load default data
    ./manage.py loaddata ./fixtures/*
    
    # load housing data
    ./manage.py load_dorms
    ./manage.py load_maps
    ./manage.py load_dorm_rooms

##Running on Windows##

Running on Windows is a bit trickier due to line endings handled by Git. 
Use these settings within Git.
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git config --global core.eol lf
(Note as you can see this is a global change, which may cause unwanted changes
to your other code. You can try to remove the global tag and see if it works.
Additional information located on: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2517190/how-do-i-force-git-to-use-lf-instead-of-crlf-under-windows)
Then reclone your files from Github and you should be ready!
